# Vonavulary

A collection of words I want to add to my vocabulary.

## Why?

The impetus for the project was to build something in order to learn and 
become comfortable with the Microsoft tech stack. However, I didn't want to 
build something that would be thrown away eventually so I came up with the 
Cog Log (cog being short for cognitive).

### Stack
- Dotnet 8
- ASP MVC
- Entity Framework
- Microsoft Identity
- Azure App Service
- AzureSQL
- Automapper
- Mediatr
- FluentValidation
- Moq
- Xunit
